RM Sythesis is technique used to transform polarized intensity between wavelength-space (lambda) and faraday-space (RM). The details can be found in Brentjen & de Bruyn (2005). The Fourier relation is given as:

This technqiue becomes computationally expensive in wide-fields and large spectral coverages. Particular, if one is to compute this Fourier transform for each pixel. Such is expected for sky surveys for instance. Thus, it is appropriate and relevant that we seek to optimize this technique. In the original implementation, each plane in lambda-space was considered at once, although this is reason and much faster, it becomes infeasible for large dataset as these have to be loaded into memory. Thus, here we evaluate each pixel individually but we have implemented multiprocessing (and we intend to extend this to GPUs) so that multiple cores can carry this task.
