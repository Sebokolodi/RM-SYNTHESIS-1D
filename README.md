RM-Synthesis is technique used to transform polarized intensity between wavelength-space (lambda) and faraday-space (RM). The details can be found in Brentjen & de Bruyn (2005).

This technqiue becomes computationally expensive in wide-field and large spectral coverage data. Particular, if one is to compute this Fourier transform all pixels -- for instance, for sky surveys. Thus, it is appropriate and relevant that we seek to optimize this technique. In the original implementation, each plane in lambda-space was considered at once, although this is reasonable and much faster, it becomes infeasible for large dataset as these have to be loaded into memory. Thus, here we evaluate each pixel individually but we have implemented multiprocessing (and we intend to extend this to GPUs) so that multiple cores can carry this task.
